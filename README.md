# Analyzing-Employee-Exit-Survey
Analyzing Employee Exit Surveys of two Institutes - Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute.
Based on this data, the idea is to analyse which segment of employees resign due to dissatisfaction. The questions to answer are - 
  
   1. Are the younger employees likely to resign due to dissatisfaction? What about the older employees?
   2. Which institute has the higher attrition rate due to dissatisfaction?
