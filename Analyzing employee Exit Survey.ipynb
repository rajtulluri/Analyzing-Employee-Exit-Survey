    "The goal of the project is to analyze the Exit Surveys collected from the Employees of Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Department of Employment, Education and Training was an Australian government department that existed between July 1987 and March 1996. At its creation, the Department was responsible for the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Education, other than migrant adult education\n",
    "   * Youth Affairs\n",
    "   * Employment and training\n",
    "   * Commonwealth Employment Service\n",
    "   * Labour market programs\n",
    "   * Co-ordination of research policy\n",
    "   * Research grants and fellowships\n",
    "\n",
    "In Australia, technical and further education or TAFE institutions provide a wide range of predominantly vocational courses, mostly qualifying courses under the National Training System/Australian Qualifications Framework/Australian Quality Training Framework. Fields covered include business, finance, hospitality, tourism, construction, engineering, visual arts, information technology and community work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the analysis is to answer the following questions - <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets from both the institutes are surveys collected from the out going employees. They have large number of columns, predominantly columns that are questions asked to the employees and the answer either boolean or on the `Likert` scale. A few of the columns, enough to get started, from both the datasets are described below:- \n",
